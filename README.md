# TechStack
TechStack app built with React JS, React Native and Redux

### How it works
In this app each piece of content is represented by a library. It works by sending the id of the library the user clicked. This id is received and the row with the id of the correspondent content is expanded.

### Redux what?
I wrote a post on my blog about Redux. You can check it [here](https://she-dev.com/introduction-to-redux/)

### Android APK
This app is available for Android.
